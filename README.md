# Multi-class Text Classification (NLP)
# 1. Summary
The aim of this project is to categorize unseen articles into 5 categories namely Sport, Tech, Business, Entertainment and Politics. Deep learning model is trained and deployed for this task. The dataset is acquired from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/susanli2016/PyCon-Canada-2019-NLP-Tutorial/master/bbc-text.csv
# 2. IDE and Framework
This project is completed mainly using VS Code IDE. The main frameworks used in this project are Numpy, Matplotlib,scikit-learn and TensorFlow Keras.
# 3. Methodology
The methodology for this project is inspired from official TensorFlow website which can be refer here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels/nlp
